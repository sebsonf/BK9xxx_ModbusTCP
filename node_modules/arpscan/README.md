# arpscan

Simple [arp-scan][arp-scan] wrapper module.

>arp-scan sends ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) queries to the specified targets, and displays any responses that are received. It allows any part of the outgoing ARP packets to be changed, allowing the behavior of targets to non-standard ARP packets to be examined. The IP address and hardware address of received packets are displayed, together with the vendor details. These details are obtained from the IEEE OUI and IAB listings, plus a few manual entries. It includes arp-fingerprint, which allows a system to be fingerprinted based on how it responds to non-standard ARP packets.

[arp-scan]: http://linux.die.net/man/1/arp-scan

Tested in Mac OSX 10.9.5 and Raspbian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy).

## Getting Started
First you need to install `arp-scan` if is not already installed.

In Mac you can use **brew**:
```
brew install arp-scan
```

On Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install arp-scan
```

Install the module with: `npm install arpscan`

If you get this error when running this module, you might have to `sudo` the command:
>pcap_lookupdev: no suitable device found


## Documentation

```
Usage: arpscan [options]

Options:

  -h, --help                   output usage information
  -V, --version                output the version number
  -C, --check-arpscan          Test to see if arp-scan is installed
  -i, --interface [interface]  Interface to scan
  -v, --verbose                Verbose mode

```


## Examples

To use the module programmatically:

```javascript
var arpscanner = require('arpscan');
arpscanner(onResult);

function onResult(err, data){
    if(err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
}
```

To use the module programmatically with promises:
```javascript
var arpscanner = require('arpscan/promise');
arpscanner()
    .then(onResult);
    .catch(onError);

function onResult(data) {
    console.log(data);
}

function onError(err) {
    throw err;
}
```


The output should be something similar to:

```javascript
[ { ip: '192.168.1.1',
    mac: 'AC:CF:23:31:9B:FC',
    vendor: 'Cisco-Linksys, LLC',
    timestamp: 1427686747854 },
  { ip: '192.168.1.132',
    mac: 'AC:CF:23:3F:9B:33',
    vendor: 'Raspberry Pi Foundation',
    timestamp: 1427686747854 },
  { ip: '192.168.1.140',
    mac: 'b8:e9:37:11:d5:5c',
    vendor: 'Sonos, Inc.',
    timestamp: 1427686747854 },
  { ip: '192.168.1.143',
    mac: '00:19:93:68:65:53',
    vendor: 'Apple',
    timestamp: 1427686747854 },
  { ip: '192.168.1.148',
    mac: 'AC:FC:23:3F:9B:23',
    vendor: 'Hi-flying electronics technology Co.,Ltd (DUP: 2)',
    timestamp: 1427686747854 } ]
```

The module also provides a `cli` interface:
```
$ arpscan
```

### Errors

If `arpscan` fails, try to run the command manually:
```
$ arp-scan -l
```
You might get an error similar to this:

>WARNING: Could not obtain IP address for interface fw0. Using 0.0.0.0 for
the source address, which is probably not what you want.
Either configure fw0 with an IP address, or manually specify the address
with the --arpspa option.
Interface: fw0, datalink type: APPLE_IP_OVER_IEEE1394 (Apple IP-over-IEEE 1394)
WARNING: Unsupported datalink type
ERROR: Could not obtain interface IP address and netmask
ERROR: pcap_lookupnet: fw0: no IPv4 address assigned

You might want to specify which interface to use:
```
$ arp-scan -interface en0 --localnet
```

## TODO
- Parse signature metadata
- Handle `arp-scan` not available in machine!
